# Swap MetaBlock Tokens with other ERC20 tokens
Hello!
This repository is for swap smart contract to swap between MBT(ERC404) tokens with other ERC20 tokens.
This is Hardhat project but test and deploy scripts are not completed yet. I am working on them but it will take some time.
But the smart contract is deployed on mainnet and tested already. It work well now.

Step by step to deploy the swap smart contract yourself.
Download SwapTokens.sol from https://github.com/genshindev316/SwapMetaBlock/contracts/SwapTokens.sol.
You can deploy this contract with Remix.
